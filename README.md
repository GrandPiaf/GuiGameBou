# GuiGameBou

[Work In Progress]

Small OpenGL game project for the Real Time Rendering course of the Master 2 prog &amp; Dev at Gamagora. It features everything we tested during this course :

- Model loading
- Texture rendering
- Shadow maps
- Camera controls
- Ambient Occlusion with SSAO
- A couple of custom shaders
- And hopefully more to come !



## Install & compile

To make this project compile, you will need to download the [SFML library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).
I was working with the version 2.5.1.
Then you need to link SMFL, to do so follow [this tutorial](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/window-opengl.php).
